1- Every BIG function is realy a CLASS with many little functions inside it.
   notice that you make the local variable of the function class attriputes,
   and whatever that big funciton manipulate them will be the member functions.

2-"NEVER UNDERESTMATE YOUR POWER, YOU ARE THE ONE'S WHO KNOW." uncle Bob to the programmers.

3- A function should not be have more than two level of indention. it is better to have
   NO level of indenting.

4- A function SHOULD NOT be greater than 5 lines.

5- A function should not take more than 3 arguments.
   if a function should take more than 3 arguments may be they should be an OBJECT.

6- Don't pass boolean to functions. because if you do they must be an if statment in
   that function that has two branches, instead you may make two function for each 
   branch and call the appropriate function, with out passing a boolean variable.

7- Do not use switch statments, because they are in all the system and you may forget
   how they work, what is the logical order to put a new case. Instead you may use 
   polymorphism.

8- The open/closed syste: a good system should be open for extending but close for modifing.

9- Side-effect: a side effect happens when the state of the system changes.(open,close)(new,del)
   you may write functions that deal with that by passing lamdas.

10- A function that return void should have a side effect.and a function that return not void 
    shoud has not side effects and this is called command aquary separation.

11- DRY(don't repeat yourself) avoid copy and paste
